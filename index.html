                            I can be described that bites of more than he can chew, metaphorically and literally! It is
                            better to be a
                            moderately
                            large fish in a big pond than a goldfish in a fishbowl. It is this mentality that got me
                            though my
                            undergraduate and
                            graduate years. I would also like to thank all people who gave me free food! I couldn't
                            have done it
                            without you.

                            My name is John Niedfeldt, and that is pronounced "Need-felt". I cannot tell you how many
                            times people have
                            mispronounced
                            my name. Recently, I even considered changing my last name, though I have a hard time
                            thinking what name I
                            should grace with
                            my association. Maybe Smith? Except for the fact that everyone would associate me with the
                            default form
                            text on the internet,
                            or Pocahontas' lover in the Disney movie, it would be great!

                            My free time is spent hanging out with friends, watching movies, binging Netflix, reading
                            books, playing
                            Ultimate (when I can
                            find people to play with), keeping up on the newest technologies, programming in Python or
                            other
                            programming languages, or
                            having deep discussions with my close friends. I also just switched careers and am now a
                            Software Developer
                            for a cyber
                            security startup called Avirtek. I have no idea where I am going to be in 10 years, but I
                            know that the
                            journey will be an
                            adventure of epic proportions, and I am the captain of my fate.
